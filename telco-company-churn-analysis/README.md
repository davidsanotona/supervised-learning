# Executive Summary
This project develops a churn prediction and revenue-at-risk estimation framework for a telecommunications customer base. By implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, the model identifies high-probability churners and calculates the potential monthly revenue loss, enabling targeted retention strategies
## Technical Methodology
- Model Logistic Regression for probability-based classification.
- Feature EngineeringAnalysis of contract types, billing methods, and service usage.
- Risk MetricsEstimation of Revenue-at-Risk based on Monthly Charges.
- EvaluationBalanced focus on Recall and Precision to minimize false negatives in churn.

## Commercial Impact 
- Retention Strategy: Enables data-driven intervention for customers with high churn probability.
- Financial Oversight: Translates complex quantitative outputs into clear, actionable insights for commercial leadership.
